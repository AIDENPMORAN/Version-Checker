# Version-Checker
New Version Checker Script:
New Features-
Its now networked and will work completely fine !!
Added Beta Feature, You Can Now Put a Beta Link So If You want Beta Testers To Not Be Greeted With a OLDER VERSION Screen.
Instead of being automatic (due to networking) we have to change it to use links instead, HOW TO USE: Go To github.com create an account,
create a new "repository" and then go into it. Once inside of it click create new file and type in your current version of your game. When making versions of your game in the script and outside of it make sure to use 1,2,3... instead of 1.0 2.0 3.0... because they are not supported. BUT IN UNITY, keep using 1.0 2.0 3.0... So then it works with app lab. ONLY in your script and your github repository should it be 1,2,3... ALSO make sure when you create the github file click on it and click "raw" then copy the link and your goodie. ENJOY!!
